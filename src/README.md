## My process

Building the HTML Markup and started styling
with scss. First used the 18px font size as stated in the style-guide, but seems not to fit, so I changed it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Tried to get into the workflow with scss and get a bett understanding of organizing the Code.
Positioning and sizing of background-image.

### Continued development

Go deeper in my learnings and do more challenges.
